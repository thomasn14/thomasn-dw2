<Layout title={pageTitle}>
  <h1>Sample Assignment</h1>
  <p>You can use this file as a template for your assignments.</p>
  <p>
    There are two possible layouts for assignment pages - normal and compact.
    Normal layout features the navigation panel along the left side of the
    screen, while compact layout makes the navigation collapse into a menu
    button on the right side of the screen. You can enable the compact layout by
    adding the <code>compact</code> prop to the Layout component:
  </p>
  <pre><code>&lt;Layout compact title="Page Title"&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>
    In Astro, we usually write styling in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag within
    each component file. This lets us keep the styles for each component together
    with the component itself. Styles that are written in one component will not
    affect other components or pages, even if you use the same class names.

<style>
  h1 {
    color: blue;
